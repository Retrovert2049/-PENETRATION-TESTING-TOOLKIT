DESCRIPTION : This toolkit is a Python-based modular penetration testing framework that provides various modules for security testing, including port scanning, brute-forcing, and more. It is designed to be extensible, allowing users to add custom modules and integrate with other tools.

The toolkit includes the following features:

* Modular Design : Each module is implemented as a separate class, making it easy to add new functionality and maintain existing code.
* Port Scanner : Scans a range of ports on a target IP address to identify open ports and services.
* Brute Forcer : Attempts to authenticate using a list of usernames and passwords to identify weak credentials.
* Command-Line Interface : Provides a simple and intuitive interface for running modules and specifying options.
* Extensible Architecture : Allows users to add custom modules and integrate with other tools, such as Metasploit or Nmap.

The toolkit is designed to be used by security professionals, penetration testers, and developers who need to perform security testing on their systems. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for identifying vulnerabilities and securing systems against attacks.
